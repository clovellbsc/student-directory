* If you want to load another csv (as opposed to students.csv) on initiating the programme, you can pass the file name e.g. second-directory.csv:
```
ruby student-directory.rb second-directory.csv
```
* This then shows what students have been loaded:
```

2. Show the students
3. Save the list to students.csv
4. Load the list from students.csv
